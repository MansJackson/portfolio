          My name is MÃ¥ns Jackson. I've worked as a waiter and a bartender
          for 7 years at some of the best restaurants in Stockholm.
          I am ambitious, charismatic and I perform well under pressure.

          Ever since I was a kid I have loved logical problems, whether it was mathematics,
          physics or pussles, and when I was 16 I discovered the world of programming.
          I spent most of my free hours after school
          teaching myself everything I could but it was mostly a hobby.

          A few years later I found out about a web development bootcamp
          provided by School of Applied Technology,
          I applied immediately and a few weeks later I found out I had gotten a spot.
          After 3 months and 500 coding hours I could officially
          call myself a professional web developer,
